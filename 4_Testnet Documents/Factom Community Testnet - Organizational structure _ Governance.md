2.  # Organizational Structure
    
    1.  > The Factom Community Testnet (“The Testnet”) is headed by The
        > Testnet Administrator, who has the option to appoint a deputy
        > or deputies if he or she wishes.
    
    2.  > The Testnet community has the option to form Working Groups.
        > These Groups will constitute discrete organisational entities
        > within the larger Testnet structure.
    
    3.  > The working groups are chaired by one or multiple chairmen,
        > which acts as the point of contact for the group. In addition
        > to this the chairmen have administrative duties as described
        > in chapter 4 of this document.
    
    4.  > The activities and organisational structure of the Testnet are
        > distinct from that of the Factom Mainnet.

3.  > Governance
    
    1.  > General Principles
        
        1.  > The Factom Community Testnet is a self-contained
            > organization without formal responsibilities to external
            > entities.
        
        2.  > This is subject to change, as an overarching Factom
            > Community Structure is likely to emerge in the near
            > future. The Testnet should be incorporated into such a
            > structure at a later stage to facilitate solid governance,
            > as well as sufficient coordination between The Testnet and
            > the broader Factom community.
        
        3.  > The Testnet Administrator is selected for a 6 month term
            > by a vote held on the 1st of May and 1st of November. The
            > candidate with the most community support shall be
            > selected as the Administrator. If there is a tie a new
            > vote will be held every consecutive day until the tie is
            > broken.
        
        4.  > Every entity which has hosted a qualified authority node
            > for the last 30 consecutive days leading up to the vote
            > will be allocated one vote. The voting period lasts from
            > 00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC and the votes will then be tallied,
            > factomized on the Mainnet and then published.
        
        5.  > A *motion of no confidence* may be put forward by any
            > entity that is hosting an authority server. To trigger a
            > vote of no confidence a total of at least 20% of the
            > Authority-entities will have to back the motion. The
            > voting period will be the held 2 days after a successful
            > motion of no confidence (UTC; 00:00-23:59). A quorum
            > requires at least 50% attendance of the authority
            > entities, and the administrator is obliged to resign if a
            > majority of the quorum casts a *no confidence* vote.

> In the event of a motion of no confidence passed, the TA is obliged to
> organise the subsequent vote. Refusal to organise the subsequent vote
> will result in the forfeiture of the position of TA.

6.  > Any changes to chapter 3.1 and 3.2 in this document requires the
    > consent of a majority of the Authority entities, and shall be
    > effected through a vote in the \#governance-channel. Notification
    > of a vote shall be given 1 week prior to the event. The voting
    > period shall last from 00:00 UTC to 23:59 UTC, and a quorum
    > requires at least 50% attendance of the authority entities.

7.  > In the event that there is only one or zero candidates who
    > apply...

2.  > Testnet Administrator
    
    1.  > The Testnet Administrator (TA) is responsible for defining
        > short-, medium- and long-term goals for The Testnet, and shall
        > ensure that the organization is effectively working towards
        > these in unison.
    
    2.  > The TA may appoint one or more deputies to assist with
        > executing his or her duties, and to whom the administrator
        > responsibilities may be transferred to for short periods of
        > time when the TA may be unavailable.
    
    3.  > The TA shall publish a monthly report in the Discord
        > \#testnet-announcements-channel, which should at minimum
        > include information on the following:

> a) New and leaving members in the authority set
> 
> b) Basic statistics:

  - > Number and type of nodes in the authority set.

  - > Number and duration of potential network stalls.

  - > Number and duration of individual node failures.

  - > Number and name of sub-testnets (if applicable).

  - > Number of total entries since last report.

  - > Number of total spent EC since last report.

1.  > The TA is responsible for maintaining and updating documentation
    > as described in chapter 7 and found in the appendix of this
    > document. The TA is also responsible for managing and updating
    > document permissions.

2.  > The TA shall maintain the Factom Community Testnet **Discord**
    > channels. This includes administering the channel groups, and
    > ensuring that channel membership reflects the organizational
    > structure as described in the appendix of this document. These
    > channels include:

a) \#testnet-chat, for general discussions and recommendations.

b) \#testnet-announcements, for announcements to the testnet comm.

c) \#testnet-workspace, for trying and sharing new testnet initiatives

d) \#testnet-admin-private, for private administrative discussions

3.  > The TA may remove entities temporarily (as described in 5.1 and
    > 5.2 in this document) from the Testnet Authority Pool, and/or the
    > Discord channel if he is convinced that the entity is not acting
    > with good intentions, is actively sabotaging the Testnet or is
    > acting as a disruptive force.

> A vote shall then be held within 72 hours where the
> 
> community will decide if the entity shall be reinstated to the Testnet
> Authority Pool or removed permanently. The vote shall be effected in
> the same manner as described in para 3.1.6 of this document.

4.  > The TA is responsible for issuing Testoids/Test credits to new
    > members of the testnet. This can be done manually, via the
    > deployment of a group which are responsible for funds, or by a
    > public Testoid/test-credit faucet.

5.  > Should the TA vacate the position before the end of their term,
    > either voluntarily or involuntarily, a by-election will be held to
    > elect a new TA in accordance with standard electoral procedures
    > outlined in clauses 3.1.3 and 3.1.4.

> The by-election should be held within 7 days of the vacancy arising.
> If the by-election falls within 30 days prior to the regular election
> outlined in clause 3.1.3, then that election will be automatically
> credited to the TA elected in the by-election.

4.  > Working Groups
    
    1.  > Testnet Community members have the power to form Working
        > Groups, coordinated through the TA, to structure and focus
        > work and administrative efforts that need to be executed to
        > maintain, develop and support activity on The Factom Community
        > Testnet.
    
    2.  > Each Working Group is centered around a *working paper* which

  - > Overview of chairman and members.

  - > Past, present and upcoming milestones.

  - > List of current and completed tasks and responsibilities in the
    > group.

  - > Group specific documentation.

        > available in the table in the appendix in this document.
    
    2.  > Working Groups, in coordination with the TA, are formed when
        > community members recognise a need for a specific function to
        > be carried out on the Testnet and there are volunteers who are
        > willing to occupy the role of Chairman and Members of that
        > Working Group. The TA can nominate a Working Group.
    
    3.  > To form a Working Group, a prospective Chairman (see 4.2)
        > should notify the TA of the intention, then submit the
        > documentation outlined in 4.1.2 to the TA. The TA will then
        > add that Group’s information to the appendix of this document.
    
    4.  > To disband a Working Group, the Chairman must inform the TA of
        > the intention to disband. If the TA wishes, he or she may seek

5.  # The Testnet Authority Set
    
    1.  > The Testnet Authority Set are those nodes operating a factomd
        > instance that performs consensus or audit on the Factom
        > Testnet.
    
    2.  > Any entity may apply to host a node within the Testnet
        > Authority Set. An **entity** in this regard are persons,
        > groups, companies or organizations that currently are, or have
        > applied to be, part of the Testnet Authority Pool (TAP).
    
    3.  > To be eligible for its nodes to join the TAP, an entity shall
        > put in an application to the *Authority Pool & Network
        > Management* *working group* as described in the *Before You
        > Start section of The Testnet’s
        > [<span class="underline">wiki-page</span>](http://www.factom-testnet.com/Before_you_start/Requirements)*.
    
    4.  > Node owners must ensure their servers comply with the
        > following minimum requirements to be included in the TAP:
        
        1.  > A CPU with a minimum of 2 cores
        
        2.  > 4 GB of RAM
        
        3.  > 50 GB of storage
        
        4.  > 20 Mbit/s synchronous
        
        5.  > Up to 1 TB per month data transfer
        
        6.  > Static IP address
        
        7.  > 99.9% uptime measured in 3-week blocks
    
    5.  > Qualified Nodes are added to the TAP, and then promoted to the
        > Authority Set by the *Authority Pool & Network Management
        > working group* when practicable.

6.  > Testnet objectives and milestones
    
    1.  > The Community Testnet main objectives
        
        1.  > Familiarize entities that might apply for hosting main net
            > Authority servers past M3 with the Factom software, as
            > well as the process around, and challenges related to,
            > stable hosting of Factom nodes.
        
        2.  > Get experience regarding a decentralized Authority set and
            > learn how “real world” scenarios affect the stability and
            > performance of the Factom network and Authority set
            > dynamics.

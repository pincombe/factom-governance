1.  # Introduction
    
    1.  > Governance Document 001 references “Grant Success”. This
        > document outlines the process by which a grant will be
        > determined successful or not which will subsequently inform
        > the Standing Parties about the effectiveness of a particular
        > grantee in delivering what was promised in the grant
        > application. This will allow better judgement of future grant
        > applications by a grantee and provide the data necessary for a
        > “Grant Success” Standing Party if so desired.

2.  # Process
    
    1.  > A grantee or sponsor may put their grant up for determination
        > at any time.
        
        1.  > If a grant has not been put up for determination by a
            > grantee or sponsor and two months has passed since its
            > final milestone or initially intended completion date. A
            > final request will be made within the grant tracking
            > thread stating. “This grant has passed due on completion
            > by over two months without being put up for determination.
            > You now have fourteen days to either put this grant up for
            > determination yourself or provide a new completion date
            > for the grant along with an explanation for the delay. It
            > will then be up to standing parties to decide whether to
            > allow this extension or force this grant to go up for
            > determination”.
        
        2.  > If the grant holder has not responded after fourteen days
            > then the grant goes up for final determination in
            > accordance with section 2.2.
        
        3.  > If the grant holder responds and provides a new completion
            > date, along with an explanation for the delay.
            
            1.  > A “Minor Discussion” thread titled “Should \[grant
                > name\] go up for final determination?” is created that
                > includes a poll. This thread is linked to in the grant
                > update thread.
                
                1.  > The poll will ask, “Should \[grant name\] go up
                    > for final determination?” with answers of “Yes”,
                    > “Delay until X date” and “Abstain” which
                    > Standing Parties can vote on.
                
                2.  > If the majority of non-abstaining voters vote yes,
                    > the grant goes up for final determination in
                    > accordance with section 2.2.
                
                3.  > If the majority of non-abstaining voters vote to
                    > delay then this process is reset to the new
                    > completion date. This means the grant holder may
                    > put their grant up for determination at any time
                    > or can be forced into determination in accordance
                    > with section 1.1.1.
    
    2.  > A poll is added to the existing “Grant Update” thread. If
        > there was no grant update thread, one will be created
        > specifically for the vote. The grant update thread should
        > contain, at minimum, a link to the original grant proposal.
        > The poll will:
        
        1.  > Ask the question, “Was \[grant name\] successful? (see
            > scoring rubric within the thread)” with possible answers
            > of 0-10 and “Abstain”.
        
        2.  > Allow all Standing Parties to be able to vote.
        
        3.  > Last for five days.
    
    3.  > The thread will be replied to by the initiator of the
        > determination bringing attention to the poll, a link to this
        > document, a summary of the grant performance, provide the
        > below scoring rubric, and provide their own score based upon
        > that rubrik as part of the summary:

> Exceptional (9.0 - 10.0) - Successful
> 
> Overachieved (7.0 - 8.9) - Successful
> 
> Achieved (5.0 - 6.9) - Successful
> 
> Underachieved (2.0 - 4.9) - Failure
> 
> Total Failure (0.0 - 1.9) - Failure

4.  > At the end of the voting period, if the average of non-abstaining
    > votes is 5 or higher, the grant is successful. If the average is
    > below 5, the grant is determined to have failed.

5.  > The grant update thread’s prefix will be changed to “Successful”
    > or “Failed”.

4.  # Guide Removal Process
    
    1.  > The removal procedure described in this document is intended

        > of Authority Node Operators (ANOs) deem worthy of initiating
        > the process, including, but not limited to, failure to fulfill
        > a Guide’s responsibilities set forth in section 2 of Doc 001.
    
    2.  > A Guide shall not be removed under this document unless the
        > procedure set forth herein is strictly followed.
    
    3.  > The Guide subject to the removal process is hereinafter
        > referred to as the “Subject Guide”.
    
    4.  > The removal process shall be commenced by an ANO representing
        > at least 10% of all the ANOs by making a motion through a
        > “Timed Thread” set as a “Major Discussion”, named “REMOVAL:
        > \[Subject Guide’s Name(s)\],” in the Governance Discussion
        > forum at the Factom community forum (the “Removal Thread”) or
        > other platform used by the community.
        
        1.  > The number of ANOs required to make a removal motion will
            > be the smallest whole number of ANOs that meet or exceed
            > 10% of the total number of ANOs. Example: for 26 ANOs, 10%
            > is 2.6 so the minimum number of the ANOs to make a removal
            > motion is three (3). The removal process shall be
            > commenced by an ANO representing at least 10% of all the
            > ANOs by making a motion through a “Timed Thread” set as a
            > “Major Discussion”, named “REMOVAL: \[Subject Guide’s

            > in and voted on by ANOs.
        
        3.  > The Timed Thread will have a poll with the subject,
            > “Should \[Subject Guide\] be Removed as a Guide?” with
            > the options of “Yes”, “No” and “Abstain”. The poll will
            > not begin until the timed discussion ends.
        
        4.  > The initiator shall provide a link to this document, the
            > names of the other 10%+ ANOs supporting the removal
            > motion, the rationale behind the removal, and any
            > supporting evidence in the first post of the thread.
        
        5.  > The Subject Guide(s) may state its case in the thread.
        
        6.  > There shall be a minimum of eight (8) days of open
            > discussion regarding the removal motion in order to give
            > the Subject Guide a reasonable opportunity to answer and
            > defend itself. As such, discussion may not be ended early
            > but may be extended following the normal procedure for
            > Major Timed Discussions.
        
        7.  > After the discussion phase has ended a vote will be
            > automatically initiated. The voting period shall be three
            > (3) days. The votes will not be revealed until the poll
            > closes.
        
        8.  > If 51% of the ANOs vote yes, the motion carries and the
            > Guide is removed. If less than 51% of the ANOs vote yes,
            > the motion fails and the Subject Guide maintains its
            > position.
    
    5.  > If the removal motion passes:
        
        1.  > The Subject Guide will be immediately removed from the
            > Guide position and its access to the community platforms
            > associated with the Guide position shall be terminated..
        
        2.  > An announcement with explanatory language agreed to by the
            > remaining Guides will be posted on Discord, Reddit, the
            > community forum, and other communication platforms for the
            > Factom Protocol.

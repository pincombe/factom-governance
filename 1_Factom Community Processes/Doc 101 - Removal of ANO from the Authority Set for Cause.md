1.  # Introduction
    
    1.  > This document provides the procedure to remove an Authority
        > Node Operator (“ANO,” and collectively, “ANOs”) from the
        > Factom Authority Set. It is created to supplement and
        > facilitate the removal of ANOs as set forth in the
        > [<span class="underline">Factom Governance Doc
        > 001</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RVaVR7lvfGgOBMG-7oca9TtpnR7qaEfr6XJVaZJwd3M/edit?usp=sharing)
        > section 3.4. All capitalized terms used herein and not
        > otherwise defined in this document shall have the meanings
        > ascribed to them in the Factom Governance Doc 001.
    
    2.  > The procedure described in this document is intended for
        > removal of an ANO for Cause only and shall constitute a
        > process independent and separate from the ANO’s ranking and
        > competition mechanism which may also result in an ANO’s
        > removal.
    
    3.  > For purpose of this document, “Cause” for removal of an ANO
        > shall be deemed to exist if the Standing Parties determine, in
        > accordance to the procedure set forth herein, that any of the
        > following has occurred: (i) the ANO has committed any action
        > or omission involving dishonesty or fraud with respect to the
        > Factom Protocol, (ii) the ANO has repeatedly or materially
        > failed to maintain the Authority Servers, including but not
        > limited to shutting off the Authority Servers without
        > providing advanced notice or explanation within a reasonable
        > time, (iii) the ANO has become unresponsive repeatedly or for
        > an extended period of time, or (iv) the ANO has failed to
        > sufficiently adhere to the ANO Expectations as set forth in
        > [<span class="underline">Doc
        > 003</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IylZOUbY5D3_qbRDDOHSFPIKoVav15h8ojTESpQP3Y0/edit?usp=sharing),
        > or (v) the ANO has committed other action or omission that
        > constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct with
        > respect to the Factom Protocol, or that involves intentional
        > conduct against the best interest of the Factom Protocol.
    
    4.  > An ANO shall not be removed or suspended under this document
        > unless the procedure set forth herein is strictly followed.
    
    5.  > The ANO subject to the removal process or the emergency
        > suspension process is hereinafter referred to as the “Subject
        > ANO.”

2.  # Initiation of Removal Motion 
    
    1.  > The removal process shall be commenced by a Standing Party by
        > making a motion through a private thread, named “REMOVAL:
        > \[Subject ANO’s Name\],” in the Governance Discussion forum at
        > the community forum or another platform utilized by the Factom
        > Community (the “Removal Thread”).
        
        1.  > The Removal Thread shall be accessible only by the
            > initiator, the Guides, and the Subject ANO.
        
        2.  > The initiator shall provide the rationale behind the
            > removal and any supporting evidence.
        
        3.  > Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.9.4, an ANO can
            > only make a removal motion against the same ANO once every
            > three months. For the avoidance of doubt, multiple removal
            > motions can be made against an ANO within the three-month
            > period provided that the motions are made by different
            > ANOs.
    
    2.  > The Guides shall notify the Subject ANO of the initiation of
        > the motion with a link to the Removal Thread and a copy of
        > this document through the contact information designated by
        > the Subject ANO to the Community as the emergency contact (the
        > “Subject ANO’s Designated Contact Information”).
    
    3.  > The Guides, at their sole discretion, can contact any party,
        > for investigative purposes.
    
    4.  > A special guide meeting shall be held after the weekly guide
        > meeting following the week in which the motion has been
        > initiated. The meeting shall be announced on the Removal
        > Thread at the least three (3) days before the meeting.
    
    5.  > If a majority of the Disinterested Guides is not present
        > throughout the meeting, the Guides shall adjourn the meeting
        > to a fixed date and time and shall announce the rescheduled
        > meeting on the Removal Thread at least three (3) days before
        > the meeting. A Guide is a Disinterested Guide if the Guide or
        > any of its affiliates (i) is not affiliated with or employed
        > by either the Subject ANO or the initiator, (ii) does not have
        > any equity interest in either of the Subject ANO or the
        > initiator, and (iii) is not a party or contemplating to be a
        > party to any transaction with the Subject ANO or the
        > initiator.
    
    6.  > The meeting shall be open to the Guides, the initiator, the
        > Subject ANO, and the parties invited by the Guides at their
        > sole discretion.
    
    7.  > During the meeting the Guides shall hold a vote, and for the
        > removal motion to pass there shall be an affirmative vote by a
        > majority of the Disinterested Guides. Disinterested Guides
        > must not abstain from the vote.
    
    8.  > The Guides shall document in the meeting minutes the Guide’s
        > rationale behind the vote, as well as any recusals. The
        > meeting minutes shall be stored in a private Google Drive
        > folder accessible only by the Guides.
    
    9.  > The Guides shall post the voting result in the Removal Thread.
    
    10. > If the removal motion does not obtain the required affirmative
        > vote, the Guides shall notify the Subject ANO through the
        > Subject ANO’s Designated Contact Information that the removal
        > process has been terminated with a link to the Removal Thread.
        > No other action shall be taken.
    
    11. > If the removal motion passes in the special guide meeting, the
        > Guides shall:
        
        1.  > expand the access to the Removal Thread and the meeting
            > minutes to all the ANOs;
        
        2.  > notify the Subject ANO through the Subject ANO’s
            > Designated Contract Information that (i) the removal
            > motion has been passed by the Guides, and (ii) all
            > subsequent notices in the removal process will be given to
            > the Subject ANO through the \#operators-private channel in
            > the Factom Community discord server
            > <span class="underline"> </span> by tagging @Operators or
            > @the Subject ANO’s team members of record; and
        
        3.  > make an announcement that a removal process has been
            > commenced against the Subject ANO and the motion has been
            > passed by the Guides, tagging @Operators and @the Subject
            > ANO’s team members of record in the \#operators-private
            > channel in the Factom Community discord server and linking
            > to the Removal Thread, the meeting minutes, and this
            > document.

5.  # Emergency Suspension 
    
    1.  > This Section 5 shall be operative during an emergency. An
        > emergency exists if an ANO has committed or threatened to
        > commit an action against the best interest of the Factom

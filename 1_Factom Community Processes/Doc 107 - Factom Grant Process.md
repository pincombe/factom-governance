Note: The blue cells mark the events that should as a minimum be
announced by the process as set forth in Section 3.1..

3.  ## Amount of Factoids to be issued in a grant round
    
    1.  > The amount of Factoids to be issued at the conclusion of the
        > grant round will be determined by the Standing Parties through
        > automation or by any appointed individual and a vote to
        > approve the final amount must be completed prior to grant
        > round voting commencing. Final grant round amount must meet a
        > ⅗ approval threshold to pass.

4.  ## Grant denomination
    
    1.  > The requested grants shall be denominated in FCT only.
    
    2.  > An applicant shall request a specific amount of FCT, which is
        > the amount of FCT that will be paid out in the coinbase
        > transactions if the grant is awarded.
    
    3.  > There will be no adjustments to the amount of FCT being paid
        > out for a grant after it has been awarded by the Standing
        > Parties.

5.  ## Grant applications; formal requirements
    
    1.  > To be considered for a Factom Community Grant, grant
        > applications must meet the following minimum requirements:
        
        1.  > Grant applications must be submitted before the
            > application deadline described in section 4.2
        
        2.  > Grant applications must be submitted on a
            > project-by-project basis and should only cover the costs,
            > expenses, and fees directly connected with the proposed
            > project.

> Example: a development grant might propose the necessary elements to
> accomplish external sharding. It probably should not include trips to
> conferences or marketing, at least not without justification. If your
> grant is to develop a small EC using application, then you might need
> to include a small marketing budget in that project proposal but be
> prepared to justify it. This will be somewhat of a grey area and we
> ask those submitting grants to comply with the spirit of the clause.

3.  > Grant applications for future work shall only cover a three-month
    > period. For future work that spans a longer timeline, the grant
    > application shall be limited in scope to cover the first three
    > months of work, starting on the date the grant is paid out. Any
    > expected additional work/costs shall be applied for in a future
    > grant round, and approved separately by the Factom Standing
    > Parties.

> Note: this limitation does not affect proposals for work
> <span class="underline">already completed</span> which can be applied
> for in any grant round and span a longer time period than 3 months.

2.  > Grant applications not adhering to the requirements described in
    > section 4.5.1 will not be accepted by the automated grant system.

## Grant application process

> The Factom Protocol uses an Automated Grant System built into the
> community forum. If a bug or other system issue results in the grant
> round being unable to commence or be finalized, the grant round will
> be delayed until the Automated Grant System is fixed, or a suitable
> solution is approved by the Standing Parties.

1.  > Applying for grants is only possible by utilizing the Automated
    > Grant System built into the community forum. Applicants
    > [<span class="underline">may start the process on this
    > webpage</span>](https://factomize.com/forums/grant-pool/).

2.  > Applicants must answer all required questions. Standing Parties
    > may add, edit, or remove questions prior to the commencement of
    > the grant round with ⅗ approval.

<!-- end list -->

7.  ## Public discussion
    
    1.  > After the grant application submission deadline described in
        > section 4.2 has passed, everyone is allowed to ask questions
        > about the grant proposal in the respective thread on the
        > community forum.
    
    2.  > Suggestions on changing scope, deliverables, timelines or
        > other matters can be provided by any entity or individual, and
        > it is up to the grant proposal submitter to decide whether
        > these suggestions should be incorporated in an updated grant
        > proposal.

8.  ## Voting on grants
    
    1.  #### General principles
        
        1.  > Authority Node Operators are eligible to vote on grants as
            > Standing Parties. Each Standing Party has the same weight
            > per vote.

> Note: When the Standing Parties are expanded to recognize additional
> Standing Parties this process <span class="underline">shall</span> be
> amended to recognize the expansion. Future standing weight is still
> TBD.

2.  > If a Standing Party does not submit a score during the voting
    > period, the Standing Party shall be deemed to have abstained from
    > voting.

<!-- end list -->

2.  #### Voting principles
    
    1.  > Rank-Based Voting (RBV) forms the basis of the voting
        > methodology in use. It is a rank-based system that allows a
        > voting party to specify its preferred options in a given set
        > of choices (from most preferred to least preferred). In doing
        > so, every party employs the same base set of values with which
        > to rank the available choices, 1-N where N is the total number
        > of grants ranked, with each rank only used once.
    
    2.  > Each grant application requires two separate voting actions,
        > an Approve/Disapprove vote and a rank-based vote, except for
        > the governance-defined grants (Anchor, and Oracle) which will
        > only have an Approve/Disapprove vote if there are no competing
        > grants. The Approve/Disapprove vote marks whether the Standing
        > Party believes the grant meets the threshold for eligibility
        > for the grant round.

> The rank-based vote is filled out simultaneously. In this vote, the
> voting party will give a rank from 1-N where N is the number of grants
> in the grant pool, and where the parties ranking of the grant starts
> at 1 as most favorable and goes to N as least favorable.

3.  > Standing Parties may *abstain* from a vote for any reason. Grants
    > abstained from must still appear on the ranking list but the
    > ranked score will not be taken into account during the score
    > averaging. Additionally, abstentions are not considered votes cast
    > and will have no effect on approving or disapproving a grant.

4.  > Voting is executed by the Standing Parties successfully submitting
    > the scoresheet via the Automated Grant System.

<!-- end list -->

3.  #### Scoring
    
    1.  > If there is no competition for the governance-defined grants,
        > then, if approved by at least ⅗ of the votes cast, they will
        > be set aside along with their corresponding FCT amounts from
        > the grant pool. Unapproved grants are not funded.  
        >   
        > If there is competition for the governance-defined grants then
        > these will be scored as per paragraph 4.8.3.2.
    
    2.  > Next, all Standing Parties’ ranks for a given grant will be
        > averaged to produce a composite score. The composite scores
        > for the grants will then be ranked from lowest composite rank
        > to highest composite rank.
    
    3.  > Then, for a non-governance grant to be eligible, it must be
        > approved by ⅗ of the votes cast. If the grant does not receive
        > the required votes, it will be removed from the list of ranked
        > grants.
    
    4.  > Finally, grants are awarded from the lowest composite rank to
        > the highest until the remaining FCT is not enough to fully
        > fund the next grant in order.
    
    5.  > If two grants tie in score, the grant that was submitted first
        > will rank above the other.

<!-- end list -->

9.  ## Grant payouts
    
    1.  > Currently grant payouts are hardcoded and implemented via
        > factomd releases specifically built to trigger coinbase
        > transactions for awarded grants.
    
    2.  > After the vote has been concluded, a manual process will start
        > to include the addresses and FCT amounts of the awarded grants
        > into the Factom code, as this is not automated at this stage.
    
    3.  > The factomd developers will seek contact through Discord (or
        > other channels as necessary) with the appropriate awarded
        > grantees to verify the FCT addresses are authentic and
        > correct.
    
    4.  > A new release of factomd will be published where the only
        > difference with the previous version will be the inclusion of
        > the grants. The developers will aim at releasing the new
        > factomd version in accordance with the table in section 4.2
    
    5.  > After 1000 blocks are built after the activation blockheight,
        > which takes approximately seven days, the grants will be
        > received by the grantees, pending no coinbase cancellation
        > message from the majority of the Authority Nodes. Authority
        > Node Operators can cancel pending coinbase-transactions
        > (through which FCT that gets created) for various reasons,
        > like mistakes, bugs, hacks etc.

10. ## Grant Tracking and success determination
    
    1.  > Recipients of grants will post an update on their grant within
        > one month of receipt in the Grant Tracking area of the
        > community forum and continue to update the community on the
        > progress at appropriate intervals.
    
    2.  > The initial post required in 4.10.1 shall contain an initial
        > intended grant completion date.
    
    3.  > If the grantee determines that they will not be able to adhere
        > to the initial intended grant completion date they shall
        > provide a revised date, as well as an explanation for the
        > delay.

> Note: For grant success determination in accordance with
> [<span class="underline">Doc
> 106</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19pG4-wM8mxmr1Om2CQUN5nB221KDEiWuJCa56jZQvgs/edit?usp=sharing),
> the initial intended completion date is used.

4.  > As part of putting the grant up for success determination as
    > described in [<span class="underline">Doc

    > a self assessment shall be presented to the Standing Parties in
    > the grant tracking thread
    > ([<span class="underline">example</span>](https://factomize.com/forums/threads/factomize-core-development-grant-update-grant-round-1-2019.1721/#post-16201)).
    > If the scope of the grant work is comparatively large and/or
    > complicated a more extensive final report should be submitted

## Indemnification & waiver

The following indemnification/waiver shall be agreed to by all
applicants:

By submitting a grant proposal or participating in the grant proposal
process, the submitter hereby agrees to release, waive, discharge
Authority Set Members, Standing Parties, and their respective employees,
contractors, agents, representatives, successors, and assigns
(collectively, the “Releasees”) from any and all liabilities, claims,
and demands of whatever kind of nature, either in law or in equity,
which arise or may hereafter arise from participating in the grant
proposal process, except for those caused by the willful misconduct or
intentional torts of the Releasees. The submitter further agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Releasees against all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments,
costs, or expenses which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred
by any Releasee as a result of, or arising out of, or relating to this
grant process contemplated by this document, including without
limitation, any judgment, settlement, attorneys’ fees and other costs or
expenses incurred in connection with the defense of any actual or

the willful misconduct or intentional torts of the Releasees.

Note: Please see [<span class="underline">the Factom governance document
(Doc
001)</span>](https://factomize.com/forums/documents/doc-001-factom-governance.9/)
for definitions of Authority Set Members, and Standing Parties. Grant
proposals submitted in another format shall include this indemnification
and waiver.

5.  # Sponsors
    
    1.  ## Sponsor Roles
        
        1.  > In the Factom Protocol, a Sponsor can be defined as an
            > individual, group of individuals, or company that acts as
            > a third party reporting agent for a funded Grant.
            > Henceforth, the term “Sponsor” or “Sponsors” can be
            > considered singular or plural, interchangeably, with
            > respect to one or more than one individual or company
            > acting as a Sponsor for a given Grant.
        
        2.  > A Sponsor aids in providing insight and oversight into a
            > Grant’s effectiveness, and can reliably comment on the
            > Grant recipient’s progress, and overall success or failure
            > of the Grant. Most importantly, the Sponsor’s reporting is
            > shared with the community in a transparent, open, and
            > discussion-based manner.
        
        3.  > Since ANO Efficiency, as defined in
            > [<span class="underline">Doc
            > 001</span>](https://factomize.com/forums/documents/doc-001-factom-governance.9/),
            > directly and wholly contributes to funding the Grant pool,
            > the Sponsor role represents a step forward in yielding
            > decentralized and transparent oversight of Protocol funds.
        
        4.  > Sponsors do not receive or achieve a position of Standing
            > in the Factom Protocol by virtue of being a Sponsor. A
            > given Sponsor may have existing Standing by interacting
            > with the Protocol in a way that provides Standing, but the
            > Sponsor role, in and of itself, is not imparted with or
            > otherwise conveyed with Standing.
        
        5.  > A given individual, group of individuals, or a company may
            > Sponsor more than one Grant at a time. There is no
            > limitation on how many Grants an individual, group of
            > individuals, or company may Sponsor at any given time. It
            > is, however, recommended that any Sponsor limit their
            > efforts in the Sponsor role to a low quantity of Grants at
            > one time so that effective and reliable reporting can be
            > provided to the community, and to best ensure that a given
            > Sponsor’s labor bandwidth is not unreasonably challenged.
    
    2.  ## Sponsor Selection
        
        1.  > A Grantee may choose to use a Sponsor or Sponsors, or the
            > community, during the discussion period, may suggest the
            > use of a Sponsor.
        
        2.  > A selected Sponsor has the right to accept or decline any
            > offer, received from a prospective Grantee, to become a
            > Sponsor.
        
        3.  > Should the role be a paid Sponsor role, the amount to be
            > paid to the Sponsor is chosen by the Grantee or by the
            > Grantee in collaboration with the prospective Sponsor.
        
        4.  > Should the role be a paid Sponsor role, the amount of
            > funds to be given to the Sponsor from the total funds
            > requested in the Grant Proposal is to be specified in the
            > application, enabling the community to have insight of the
            > Sponsor’s compensation for filling the Sponsor role for
            > the given Grant.
        
        5.  > The Sponsor shall provide their specified payout address
            > in the Grant Proposal. When a Grant is paid out, the
            > Sponsor should also be paid out at the same time with
            > funds delivered from the Grant Pool to the Sponsor’s
            > payout address specified in the Grant Proposal.
    
    3.  ## Sponsor Reporting
        
        1.  > If a Sponsor has been chosen and accepts their position
            > for a given Grant, and the Grant receives funding, status
            > updates, progress reports, and a final report, pursuant to
            > the Grant, should be published by the Sponsor in
            > collaboration with the Grantees. Thus, ideally Grantees
            > are not tasked with reporting on their own Grant, and
            > Sponsors are tasked with reporting to the community on the
            > given Grant. With more complex Grants, report generation
            > may be the purview of the Grantee.
        
        2.  > Sponsors shall engage with the Grantee to produce progress
            > reports and a final report. The progress reports will
            > update the community as to the progress of the Grant. The
            > final report will specify the success or failure of the
            > Grant and provide any final details.
        
        3.  > All reports (inclusive of progress reports and final
            > report) will be presented to the community in the
            > respective Grant’s thread in the Grant Tracking section of
            > the community forum.
        
        4.  > Sponsors shall engage with the Factom Protocol community
            > when questions arise or when details are subsequently
            > requested by community members on the community forum.
            > Thus, the community can request clarification or further
            > detail into the inner workings of the Grant, and the
            > Sponsor can respond to these inquiries.
    
    4.  ## Sponsor Accountability
        
        1.  > Ideally, the Sponsor reports to and is accountable towards
            > the community. However, the Grantee is ultimately
            > responsible for reporting on their own Grant, even when a
            > Sponsor is utilized, and in the event that the Sponsor
            > does not fulfill their obligations to report to the
            > community, for whatever reason, the Grantee should locate
            > another Sponsor or should report on their Grant’s
            > progress, directly.
        
        2.  > Sponsors should, to the best of their ability, report on a
            > Grant’s progress, funding, insights, and eventual success
            > or failure with objectivity, honesty, absence of bias, and
            > represent the community’s best interest.
        
        3.  > Sponsors should make themselves available to the
            > community, and should respond to inquiries or prompts from
            > the community on the community forum in a reasonable
            > amount of time.

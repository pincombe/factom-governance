# Introduction

> Factom Community,  
>   
> We are as excited as you to announce the second election round for
> future Authority Node Operators after the successful rollout of
> Milestone 3 (M3) bringing full decentralization to the Factom
> protocol. We feel it is important that we set proper expectations. The
> M3 code is still early in its development; as such we will have
> challenges in this process. There are components that need more
> testing. The rollout will be phased in over a period of time, so set
> your expectation appropriately. Not everyone who applies for an
> Authority Node will be approved and even selected applicants have to
> wait in a queue before going live on the mainnet. **As such, take this
> into account when deciding how much time, energy, and money you put
> into this project**. The overall crypto market is also not doing us
> any favors currently. In general, the protocol and community are
> moving as quickly and prudently as possible, but all parties should
> understand that everything is still pretty fluid. In short do not take
> undue risks.
> 
> In this selection round a maximum of
> **<span class="underline">6</span>** Authority Node Operators will be
> selected.
> 
> Sincerely,
> 
> **The Factom Protocol Guides**

# 2\. Governance

> Pursuant to Section 3 of the [<span class="underline">Factom Protocol
> Governance
> Document</span>](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c3ujiauzfq49lezphcEf2niu6kN3oFpe),
> membership in the Authority Set will currently be granted by the
> Guides.

# 3\. Current Authority Set

> As of 4th of July 2018 there are 14 Authority Node Operators (ANOs)
> live on the Factom mainnet, with an additional 7 in the queue waiting
> to be onboarded. The waiting parties will not receive FCT until they
> are live on mainnet. This application may result in additional
> Entities being elected to join the queue. Each Entity will operate two
> Factom authority servers with the knowledge that some point in the
> future, this will become one. Queued entities will be onboarded at a
> pace decided by the Guides in cooperation with core personnel at
> Factom inc. The onboarding will happen in order of election; and the
> elected ANOs will be divided into groups (batches) of 3-4 entities
> each. Once the total queue nears completion, the guides will decide if
> a new campaign round should be initiated or put off a while. Newly
> elected Authority Node operators will fall in line behind the original
> Queue if any of those entities are not yet onboarded and running
> Authority Servers on Mainnet.

# 4\. Scoring - How

> Each Guide will have 100 points they can award per Entity
> [<span class="underline">using this scoring
> matrix</span>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zyc-DwbueZGxN94gUi-E7RYxmFaSwCHhNuIzOwixllg/edit#gid=0).
> The total of the five Guides scores will be divided by five to make
> the final score for each entity. If a Guide or Guides have to recuse
> themselves, the total score will be divided by the number of Guides
> who were able to vote. Scores for each Guide and Entity will be posted
> at the same time and shared publicly [<span class="underline">in this
> Google
> sheet</span>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LxwWDvKx8luzh52KJ-21-pAzUDSZ9n4Azd5iRnIhNS4/edit?usp=sharing).
> The guide scores will be normalized in order to make sure individual
> guides do not influence the scores, by for instance having a different
> standard deviation and average from each other. This especially would
> come into play when a guide would have to recuse himself.
> 
> Guides may discuss applicants and scores together in private, in
> public, or work separately.
> 
> Guides reserve the right to reject your application.
> 
> There will be no appeals but Applicants can re-submit in future
> elections.

# 5\. Scoring - Criteria

> Due to the governance maturity, the campaign criteria will be 100%
> weighted on the decision of the Guides and a couple variables. A
> matrix Guides will use [<span class="underline">can be seen
> here</span>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zyc-DwbueZGxN94gUi-E7RYxmFaSwCHhNuIzOwixllg/edit#gid=0).
> Over time, Guides will add in additional variables and hand over
> voting control to the Standing Parties as outlined in the Governance
> Document.
> 
> **<span class="underline">A minimum average guide score of 60 out of
> 100 (60%) is required to be included in the Factom Authority
> Set.</span>**

# 6\. How to apply

To apply for becoming a Factom Authority Node Operator, complete steps

1-5 below between July 16th (00:00 UTC) and
**<span class="underline">July 30th 2018 (23:59 UTC)</span>**.

> Note: All steps MUST be completed prior to the deadline above (green
> text). No applications filed after this date and time will be
> considered in this round (batch \#2).

1.  > [<span class="underline">Fill out this Google
    > Form</span>](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/1ZEYTlBsCEQQKPyidWsyFY-DCijS2751_T-sYxSUQihw/edit?usp=forms_home&ths=true)
    > regarding your server’s location.

> Note: All current and submitted server locations is visible in
> [<span class="underline">this
> spreadsheet</span>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LlBpIrMs1RHrCk5y19r_6Z1B8xaKp3m7NMf_7RZ2Tr0/edit?usp=sharing).
> Reference to **in use** below includes any servers currently in the
> Authority Set, or already elected and in queue for onboarding.

**The server location score is determined by the following variables**:

**0 points**: Server with cloud “availability zone” (or similar) or
datacenter already in use.

> **5 points**: Server in an unused cloud “availability zone” (or
> similar) or in a datacenter not in use.
> 
> As each ANO will be allowed to operate two servers, the scores for the
> two servers will be added together.

2.  > [<span class="underline">Review the technical specifications
    > sheet</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MF2E9G_hZ3bD0EwKlbsTNvaHMcHqJkLAIfYJb-AGJfg/edit?usp=sharing)
    > to help you determine your server specs.

3.  > Fill out the following two Google forms. We made a distinction
    > because the private form captures personal data, that will not be
    > shared outside of current and future guides and onboarding
    > members, whilst the application information in the public form
    > will be shared in public.

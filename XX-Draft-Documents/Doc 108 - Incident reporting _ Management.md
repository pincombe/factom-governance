1.  # Introduction
    
    1.  > This document describes the process for incident reporting for
        > issues related to the Factom network as well as individual
        > nodes. All chapters of this document are important, but mainly
        > chapters 2 and 3 are of vital importance for the reporter of
        > the incident, as it describes required actions on his/her
        > part.
    
    2.  > The types of incidents we experience most of the time falls
        > into two categories;
        
        1.  > **<span class="underline">Individual authority node
            > stalls/crashes;</span>** Most of the time these only
            > influence the failed node. There are many failure modes
            > that can lead up to a node crash; examples are: Bug(s) in
            > the factomd-code, network issues, running out of disk
            > space, botched brain-transfer/swap etc..
        
        2.  > **<span class="underline">Network stalls</span>**. These
            > incidents have an impact on everyone utilizing the Factom
            > blockchain as it is unavailable until the network is
            > rebooted. These happen most of the time because of
            > failsafe conditions in the Factom code to prevent forks of
            > the Factom blockchain, as well as due to failed authority
            > elections when one or multiple node stalls.

2.  # Incident Reporting
    
    1.  > An ANO experiencing an authority node failing (crash, stall,
        > network outage etc.) or identifies a network stall, is
        > required to create an incident report in the discord channel
        > **\#incident-management** channel, tagging the role
        > **@Incidents** as the first line. This ensures people handling
        > incidents are notified.
    
    2.  > When a **<span class="underline">network stall</span>** is
        > detected only one ANO incident report is required, and
        > subsequent ANOs joining the \#incident-management channel is
        > not required to file duplicate reports.
    
    3.  > The incident-management channel is available for everyone to
        > use. All who can aid with the incident is welcome to help and
        > participate, as incident management is a collaborative effort.
    
    4.  > **<span class="underline">Filing the report:</span>**
        
        1.  > Please provide the following information in your incident
            > report:
            
            1.  > The tag @Incidents.
            
            2.  > Date and time when the issue occured;

> (format: YYYY-MM-DD, HH:MM UTC)

3.  > Categorization (next chapter) & node type;

> (node stall/crash/instability (type),network stall? Other? Federated,
> Audit or follower node? Election triggered?

4.  > Initial Impact & Urgency (next chapter)

> Impact can be high or low. Urgency can be high or low. Please see the
> next chapter for more explanation about this.

5.  > Create a Google document (text) file
    > [<span class="underline">here</span>](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O0RKBUOlMFNvbHQKfvyaE-degRoQqZjt)
    > in the folder corresponding to the current year and adhering to
    > the following naming standard:

> \<YYYY-MM-DD\_HH-MM\>\_\<Operator-name\>\_\<version\>
> 
> (examples: <span class="underline">2018-07-17\_00-40\_TFA\_01</span>
> or <span class="underline">2018-08-01\_12-15\_BIF\_05</span> ).

6.  > Paste/Place your factomd/docker logs in the above. document.
    > *Please only paste the relevant sections, but do not limit it too
    > much. If unsure paste everything.*

> (use the following command: <span class="underline">docker logs -t
> factomd</span>).

7.  > Post a link in Discord to the log-file above if relevant.

> (Tip: Embed the link in \<LINK\> to avoid previewing the file).

8.  > Reason for incident.

> (format: Reason: Unknown / Reason: factomd panic / Reason: user
> error).

9.  > Any additional information you may have.

> (did the incident happen when working on the node, connectivity
> issues, related incidents?).

3.  # Categorization and prioritization
    
    1.  > After the incident is reported somebody from the core- and
        > code deployment committee will pick up the incident.
    
    2.  > Incidents are preliminary categorized by the reporter itself
        > and later finalized by someone of the committee. The most
        > prominent categories are:
        
        1.  > Network stall
        
        2.  > Node crash
    
    3.  > The incident will get a unique consecutive number assigned to
        > it (format: FIN-YY-00x for network incidents and NODE-YY-00x
        > for node incidents) and it will be entered into the respective
        > category tab in the Factom Network Incident Log
        > [<span class="underline">here</span>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xPfEjTETUulqO35aMjvEKMkGxroYwfatv6JYnCcuBMY/edit#gid=0).
    
    4.  > The incident gets prioritized using a combination of Impact
        > and Urgency to determine a Priority. A preliminary Impact and
        > Urgency determination is done by the reporter. The final
        > values will be made by committee members. For our use-case we
        > will probably see the impact and urgency categories having the
        > same values most of the time, given the impact and urgency are
        > highly correlated in our case.
    
    5.  > The Factom Network stalls whenever something of importance
        > happens in the network which shouldnâ€™t have happened and
        > cannot be resolved automatically. This is a deliberate
        > security measure to prevent forks of the blockchain.
    
    6.  > **Impact**

> Impact is primarily determined by the scope of the effect of the
> incident.

1.  > **High Impact events:**
    
    1.  > Factom network is down/stalled.
    
    2.  > Multiple nodes are affected.
    
    3.  > The incident affects multiple users of the protocol.

2.  > **Low Impact events:**
    
    1.  > Only one node is affected.
    
    2.  > The incident affects only a small number of users of the
        > protocol.

<!-- end list -->

7.  > **Urgency**

> Urgency is mainly determined by how quickly an incident has an effect
> on the whole network.

1.  > <span class="underline">High Urgency:</span>
    
    1.  > The effects of the incident are expanding or quick action is
        > necessary.
    
    2.  > Important or time sensitive work/customers are affected.
    
    3.  > The Incident affects one or multiple FCT exchanges.

2.  > <span class="underline">Low Urgency:</span>
    
    1.  > The effects of the incident appear stable.
    
    2.  > Important or time sensitive work/customers are not affected.

<!-- end list -->

8.  > **Priority**

> The priority is a direct result of the Impact and the Urgency and is
> used to determine the pickup time, escalation level and speed at which
> the incident needs to be resolved.

|             | **Impact** |     |   |
| ----------- | ---------- | --- | - |
|             | **High**   | Low |   |
| **Urgency** | **High**   | 1   | 3 |
|             | Low        | 3   | 5 |

> Note: Normally you would see a medium impact and urgency as well.
> Given it is highly unlikely in a distributed network that needs to
> work together we will be seeing medium impacts and urgencies we left
> them out. In order to make sure they could be taken into account in
> the future the priority matrix does account for future inclusion of
> medium values, hence priority 2 and 4 are left out.

| **Priority** |          |                                                                   |
| ------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1            | Critical | Urgent action required, escalation almost immediately             |
| 3            | Medium   | Quick action required, however escalation might not be necessary. |
| 5            | Low      | No direct action required. No escalation.                         |

4.  # Initial diagnosis and escalation
    
    1.  > Initial diagnosis is done in the **\#incident-management**
        > channel on Discord and is open to everybody that can
        > contribute. Basically this is the process of asking the
        > initial questions to better determine the problem at hand.
        > ANO-representatives should follow the direction of members of
        > the core-committee, and
    
    2.  > Whenever an incident has priority 1 and needs to be handled by
        > somebody from the core- and networking committee or by Factom
        > Inc, the incident will be escalated when nobody appropriate to
        > handle the incident is available at the time.
    
    3.  > Incidents with a priority of 3 or higher will be escalated as
        > well when they cannot be handled by current users in the above
        > channel, but at an appropriate time. Please note that
        > escalation in this context means getting a person involved
        > with more appropriate knowledge to solve the incident at hand.
        > This can be done by anybody in the committee.

5.  # Status updates
    
    1.  > Whenever warranted by the priority status updates to external
        > parties will be given. Parties are for instance users of the
        > protocol, exchanges, ANO etc.
    
    2.  > Status updates will given at appropriate times when there is
        > something to report, or whenever a priority 1 incident is
        > ongoing; at least every 3 hours, so parties know it is still
        > being investigated or worked on.
    
    3.  > Updates will be posted in the **\#incident-management**
        > channel on Discord.
    
    4.  > For network wide incidents Factom Inc will update the
        > [<span class="underline">https://status.factom.com</span>](https://status.factom.com)
        > status page with updates about the incident. External parties
        > can subscribe to updates via an e-mail service hosted at this
        > site.
    
    5.  > Exchanges will be informed based on existing communication
        > channels with the respective exchanges.

6.  # Investigation and diagnosis
    
    1.  > Whenever an incident cannot be resolved during initial
        > diagnosis, incident investigation and diagnosis will be
        > initiated by the core committee. In most situations this will
        > involve Factom Inc, where they try to reproduce the incident
        > under controlled conditions or work directly with the incident
        > reporter. Whenever dialogue with the initial incident reporter
        > is warranted, communications will be effected using the
        > **\#incident-management** channel, unless information of a
        > sensitive nature is being discussed.
    
    2.  > Whenever a bug is resolved that was seen in one or more
        > incident reports, the release notes of Factomd shall mention
        > the affected incident numbers.

7.  # Resolution, Reporting & Closure
    
    1.  > Solving the incident sometimes can be an integral part of the
        > investigation & diagnosis, but often software development is
        > needed to fix a bug and add (regression) tests to the
        > software. Unless the incident is a priority 1 bug and it is
        > determined by the core- and code deployment committee and
        > urgent fix is required, bug-fixes will be rolled out during
        > normal release procedure and cadence. Sometimes a temporary
        > workaround can be necessary in the meantime.
    
    2.  > After an incident of at least priority 3 the core- and code
        > committee will create and after-action report about the
        > incident and whenever it is an incident that affects multiple
        > parties that after-action report will be shared with the
        > operators and other parties in the \#incident-management
        > channel.

1.  Introduction
    ============

    1.  This document describes a set of expectations of an Authority
        > Node Operator (ANO) in the Factom protocol. The purpose of
        > this document is to establish a standard for ANOs' conduct and
        > to serve as a framework to measure and compare the
        > performances of the ANOs. An ANO's failure to sufficiently
        > adhere to the expectations set forth herein may constitute a
        > cause for removal of the ANO as described in Doc 101.

    2.  All capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined in
        > this document shall have the meanings ascribed to them in
        > [[Doc 001 - Factom
        > Governance]{.underline}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RVaVR7lvfGgOBMG-7oca9TtpnR7qaEfr6XJVaZJwd3M).

2.  Core Requirements
    =================

> Core requirements are expectations that either impact the Factom
> network or relate to ANO pledges. An ANO's failure to adhere to them
> may result in the ANO\'s removal or immediate suspension from the
> Authority Set in accordance with [[Doc 101 - Removal of ANO from the
> Authority set for
> cause.]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JhdOhz7e93_oSpQ3JzE9YwbH5Y05rnULsOI_hf2UGr4/edit?usp=sharing)

1.  ANOs must respond promptly to Emergency Alerts.

    1.  ANOs must respond to any and all Factom Emergency Alert triggers
        > within two (2) hours of the occurrences of the trigger events.
        > This allows critical updates and network restarts to happen in
        > a timely manner which is vital for the stability and vitality
        > of the protocol and therefore its value to end users.

2.  ANOs must update their associated Factomd Authority nodes promptly.

> ANOs must adhere to the following update schedules:

1.  Within seven (7) days for ordinarily scheduled factomd software
    > updates.

2.  Prior to the activation height for updates with such a requirement.

3.  As suggested during a network emergency situation.

3.  ANOs discovering bugs or vulnerabilities in the Factom protocol must
    > not disclose these bugs or vulnerabilities publically for at least
    > ninety (90) days or until the bug or the vulnerability has been
    > protected against. Bugs and vulnerabilities must be raised to the
    > Code, Core and Technical Committee/Working Group to allow patches
    > to be installed across the network.

4.  ANOs must report anomalies and provide logs to the Code, Core and
    > Technical Committee/Working Group upon request and adhere to any
    > other incident and alerting processes approved by the Standing
    > Parties.

5.  ANOs must maintain updated emergency contact information via the
    > Emergency Contact Information form.

6.  ANOs must make reasonable and good faith efforts to adhere to their
    > currently listed ANO-pledges.

7.  ANOs must make every effort to operate their Authority node servers
    > as close to 100% uptime as possible, not counting
    > network/infrastructure-related issues beyond their control.

8.  If an ANO suspects or knows that either one of their nodes or their
    > Factom authority identities have been compromised by a third
    > party, they must disclose this information as soon as possible to
    > the chair(s) of the Code, Code and Technical Committee/Working
    > Group.

> Internal changes in an ANO\'s sysadmin composition might also
> constitute a risk, and should be discussed with the committee, if
> deemed relevant by the ANO, to ensure the safety of the Authority
> Identity keys and the wider Factom network.
>
> Self-reporting is an important aspect of maintaining and increasing
> the Factom network\'s security as a whole. It enables the Code, Code
> and Technical Committee to reveal and identify potential system
> security issues, and ensures that Authority nodes are not operating
> with compromised identities. As such, ANOs should not be punished
> socially for issues that they have self-reported.

Suggestions
===========

> Suggestions are expectations sourced from the community; and while not
> formal requirements, an ANO\'s repeated, prolonged, or accumulated
> failure may result in the ANO\'s removal from the Authority Set in
> accordance with [[Doc 101 - Removal of ANO from the Authority set for
> cause.]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JhdOhz7e93_oSpQ3JzE9YwbH5Y05rnULsOI_hf2UGr4/edit?usp=sharing)

1.  ANOs should take part in Factom governance in a meaningful way.

        > adopts.

    2.  ANOs should utilize the "ANO Contributions" subforum to post
        > updates on their projects, contributions, or other activities

        > posted elsewhere and linked to within the forum.

    3.  ANOs should timely follow at least ninety percent (90%) of
        > "Minor" or "Major" discussion threads and Document
        > Ratification threads they are invited to even if they don't
        > participate otherwise.

2.  An ANO's value provided to the protocol should be commensurate with
    > their node efficiency.

3.  ANOs should announce any changes to their efficiency in their ANO
    > Contributions update threads.

4.  ANOs should engage the community in the event that their pledges
    > require any modification or update by posting in their ANO
    > Contributions threads.

5.  ANOs should attend ANO meetings.

6.  ANOs should make reasonable efforts to have at least one person from
    > their team attend Factom Retreats which may be held once per year.

7.  ANOs should provide relevant information for the "Major
    > Contributors" section on factomprotocol.org and keep it updated.

8.  ANOs should support the marketing efforts of Factom protocol
    > announcements.

1.  Introduction and Terms
    ======================

    1.  This document provides the procedure to elect new, continue to
        > support, or demote Factom Authority Node Operators ("ANOs,"
        > and individually, "ANO"). It is created to supplement and
        > facilitate the election and removal of ANOs as set forth in
        > the [[Factom Governance Doc
        > 001](https://factomize.com/forums/documents/doc-001-factom-governance.9/)
        > ("Doc 001")]{.underline} section 3. All capitalized terms used
        > herein and not otherwise defined in this document shall have
        > the meanings ascribed to them in Doc 001.

    2.  Objective measures will be designed and approved by Standing
        > Parties and then implemented via an amendment to Doc 001
        > (\"Factom Governance Document\"). When implemented, they will
        > account for a percentage of ANO standing.

> Note: The system described and implemented via this document is not
> contingent on objective criteria being added.

3.  **Terms:**

> **Standing** - An ANO or candidate ANO's amount of support from
> Standing Parties, calculated as a percentage in the following manner:
> ***support-votes** / \[number of\] **standing parties** \* **100***.
>
> **Candidate ANO** - A team that has submitted its ANO application but
> has not yet received enough Standing to become an ANO.
>
> Note: An applicant stays an ANO candidate if there are no ANO
> positions available, even if it has accrued enough standing (60%) to
> be elected.
>
> **ANO Standing Dashboard** - The interface on the community forum
> Standing Parties use to provide or remove support from ANOs and
> Candidate ANOs.

2.  Process Overview
    ================

    1.  The protocol forum will host a public ANO Standing Dashboard
        > that is permanently visible to all parties and displaying
        > real-time Standing levels (in percentages, ranked from top to
        > bottom). The system will start with all Standing Parties with
        > "Blank Vote" but will be expected to make that vote within two
        > months. Nobody will enter a 90 day notice period until all
        > Standing Parties have cast all their initial votes or those
        > two months are up, whichever is first.

    2.  If an ANO drops below 40% Standing on the ANO Standing
        > Dashboard, they are immediately notified and have 90 days to
        > improve and rise above 40%. If they do not, they are removed
        > from the Authority Set after those 90 days. If they move back
        > above 40% during the 90-day period and drop down again
        > thereafter, they once again have 90 days to improve.

    3.  To ensure that any ANOs that drop below 40% Standing have their
        > Standing reevaluated by all Standing Parties before the 90 day
        > \"on notice\" period has concluded, Standing Parties are
        > expected to update their support-votes at a minimum cadence of
        > every 60 days. Standing parties can of course update their
        > support-votes for Standing for ANOs at any time.

    4.  All current ANOs will automatically be listed on the election
        > dashboard where Standing Parties can choose to "Support" or
        > "Not Support" based upon the contributions of the ANO. These
        > votes can be changed as many times as the Standing Party
        > wants. A means to comment and answer questions will be built
        > into the system.

    5.  Current ANOs MUST be demoted by having less than 40% support for
        > 90 consecutive days before a Candidate ANO can take their
        > position. It does not matter if a Candidate ANO has a higher
        > Standing if the ANO has not been demoted. The moment an ANO is
        > demoted, if a candidate ANO has 60% or higher Standing, the
        > Candidate becomes an ANO. If that new ANO drops below 40% at
        > any point, even prior to their server being onboarded, they
        > have the normal 90 days to increase their Standing.

    6.  An ANO position will remain unfilled if a current ANO is demoted
        > and there is no Candidate ANO with minimum 60% support to take
        > its place. In this situation the first candidate ANO to
        > achieve 60% support will be elected ANO.

    7.  Candidate ANOs will be required to submit an ANO application and
        > answer questions from the community. Submissions can be done
        > at any time throughout the year. At that point they will be
        > added to the ANO Dashboard at 0% Standing and will need to
        > work to increase that in whatever way(s) they deem viable.

    8.  The Factom Protocol Guides will, twice per year, in week 5 and
        > 31,decide if the number of default ANO positions will stay the
        > same or increase (to a maximum of 65), using a vote during a
        > Guide meeting. They will announce their rationale for this
        > decision on the Factom Protocol forum and Factom Discord
        > server.

> Note: When the updated number of ANO positions are available the ANO
> Election and Demotion system shall be updated as soon as possible to
> reflect the changes.

9.  Vacant ANO positions (either through ANO removal or addition of
    > additional ANO positions) will be filled by ANO Candidates with
    > 60% or greater Standing in an order from highest to lowest.

10. A new Candidate ANO that has put in an application will be displayed
    > on the ANO support dashboard for 6 months to ensure a fair
    > exposure to Standing Parties. Candidate ANOs will be shown along
    > with the current Authority Set and the Standing Parties will be
    > able to indicate support of Candidate ANOs in the same manner as
    > for current ANOs. If the Candidate ANO does not have at least 25%
    > Standing after the 6 months, they will be removed from the ANO
    > Standing Dashboard.

11. If no ANO positions are added by Guides or opened up as a result of
    > current ANOs being demoted, no new ANOs will be promoted from the
    > Candidate ANOs. Candidate ANOs can automatically be promoted
    > directly to ANO status by obtaining 90% support of the Standing
    > Parties even if an ANO spot has not become available through ANO
    > demotion or by Guides making more ANO slots available. In such an
    > event the ANO position is automatically created, and the number of
    > ANO's is increased by one.

> Note: This does not apply if there are 32 ANO's or more currently in
> the Authority Set.

12. In a situation where the ANO Election and Demotion System becomes
    > unavailable for any reason, automatic elections and demotions are
    > suspended. If a current ANO has less than 40% support when the
    > system becomes unavailable, and the system is not restored when
    > the ANOs *90 days* (see section 4.5) have expired, the guides
    > shall organize a binary support poll for the ANO in question to
    > determine if it shall be demoted or not.

13. When any Standing Party resigns, is removed, or is replaced, all
    > support-votes provided by that standing party are removed, and the
    > number of standing parties is updated to count only active
    > standing parties.

4.  ANO Promotion / Demotion Process
    ================================

    1.  Promotions and demotions will happen on a continuing basis.

    2.  Standing parties can and should continuously vote throughout the
        > year to show their support or non-support for both current
        > ANOs and Candidate ANOs.

    3.  The Guides shall announce promotions / demotions on the
        > community platforms.

    4.  If there are multiple Candidate ANOs tied at 60% support or
        > higher and not enough open slots, then the Candidate ANO that
        > submitted their initial application first will be promoted to
        > ANO.

    5.  After 90 consecutive days below 40% Standing, ANOs shall be
        > demoted from the Authority Set as soon as practically possible
        > and access removed from ANO-only functionality on the
        > community platforms. Every current ANO agrees to fully
        > cooperate with this process and to only act upon designation
        > of and in coordination with the Core Committee.

    6.  A promoted ANO is expected to have successfully completed the
        > procedure described in [[Doc
        > 204]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eYf_62ctbcDlc_9AAmCqt2FHR8s60VMr7HGxniAoPc0/edit?usp=sharing)
        > within 28 days of being promoted to ANO status.

    7.  The promoted ANO will be allowed to operate authority servers as
        > follows:

        1.  2 servers in the Authority Set if there are less than 32
            > ANOs at the time of promotion.

        2.  1 server in the Authority Set if there are 32 or more ANOs
            > at the time of promotion.

    8.  The Factom Core-committee should start the process of including
        > the promoted ANOs node identity/identities into the Authority
        > Set within 7 days after the promoted ANO has notified them
        > that the procedure described in Doc 204 is complete.

    9.  A promoted ANO is expected to adhere to [[Doc
        > 003]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IylZOUbY5D3_qbRDDOHSFPIKoVav15h8ojTESpQP3Y0/edit?usp=sharing)
        > (ANO expectations) from the time their identities are included
        > in the Authority Set.

    10. As soon as practical, [[Doc

        > and [[Doc
        > 208]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fopTNg7ZnokwybEwC6H7W3vEAmNMkyFd_3xumDj5q0Q/edit?usp=sharing)
        > shall be updated by the Factom Protocol Guides with the
        > changes to the ANO composition and digital identities

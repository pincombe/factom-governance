Introduction
============

> The Factom Protocol is one of the most decentralized blockchain
> projects in existence. Governance, development, and infrastructure are
> largely decentralized yet there is value in having a primary and
> central website for information. For the Factom Project, that website
> is factomprotocol.org. A single entity controlling the website would
> be contrary to the decentralization ethos, thus this document outlines
> how it is to be governed and how additional websites can be brought
> under the nonprofit corporation which is intended to serve as the
> legal entity to house and manage certain assets and activities for the
> Factom Community.

1.  Website Committee
    =================

    1.  The creation of the Website Committee shall be voted upon by the
        > Standing Parties and must pass with a majority of votes cast.

    2.  The Website Committee shall consist of the following natural
        > persons:

> \(i\) one member from and appointed by the Marketing Committee;
>
> \(ii\) one member from and appointed by the Core and Code Committee;
>
> \(iii\) one member from and appointed by the Legal Research Working
> Group;
>
> \(iv\) one member from and appointed by the Documentation Committee
>
> \(v\) one member from and appointed by DBGrow on condition that DBGrow
> remains as an Authority Node Operator and the website
> factomprotocol.org remains as the community website;
>
> \(vi\) one member from an Authority Node Operator who shall be elected
> in the manner set forth in Section 2.2.1 (“ANO Member”);
>
> \(vii\) one FCT holder (or a representative thereof in the event the
> FCT holder is not a natural person), who shall not be affiliated with
> any Authority Node Operator and who shall be elected in the manner set
> forth in Section 2.2.1 (“FCT Holder Member”); and
>
> \(viii\) one member from and appointed by the grantor of each
> additional website to be conveyed to the nonprofit. Grantors are not
> eligible to receive more than one committee membership designation.
>
> An individual shall be deemed from an entity/group specified in this
> Section if the individual is an employee, independent contractor,
> director, officer, partner, shareholder, or member of the
> entity/group.
>
> A FCT holder shall be deemed affiliated with an Authority Node
> Operator if the FCT holder, directly or indirectly, through one or
> more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common
> control with the Authority Node Operator. As used herein, controls,
> control and controlled means the possession, direct or indirect, of
> the power to direct the management and policies of a person, whether
> through the ownership of the voting interests of such person, through
> contract or otherwise.

1.  The ANO Member and the FCT Holder Member shall be elected by the
    > Standing Parties in the manner set forth below:

    1.  An independent thread shall be created on the community forum or
        > any other platform utilized by the Factom Community for each
        > type of candidates. The thread for the ANO candidates shall be
        > titled “ANO Member Candidates for the Website Committee” and
        > the thread for the FCT Holder candidates shall be titled “FCT
        > Holder Candidates for the Website Committee.” The threads
        > shall remain open for seventy-two (72) hours.

    2.  Candidates can announce they are running in the respective
        > thread and provide their experience and knowledge pertaining
        > to running a website.

    3.  After the seventy-two (72) hours, a single “Minor Discussion”
        > poll will be started with the title, “Elect members to the
        > Website Committee”.

    4.  For the duration of the minor discussion, the Standing Parties
        > can ask the candidates questions.

    5.  The poll will ask the question, “Which candidate(s) should join
        > the Website Committee”?.

    6.  The answers will be the names of the candidates in alphabetical
        > order with \[ANO\] or \[FCT Holder\] after the names.

    7.  Standing Parties can vote for as many candidates as they want.

    8.  At the end of the poll, the ANO candidate and FCT holder
        > candidate with the most votes, and at least 50% of the votes,
        > will be elected.

    9.  If there is a tie, the candidates that are tied will be part of
        > a revote following the procedures from Section 2.2.1.3 to
        > Section 2.2.1.8 except that the seventy-two (72) hours for the
        > candidacy announcements shall not apply and the Standing
        > Parties shall only vote for one of the candidates.

    10. If an ANO candidate or FCT holder candidate gets the most votes
        > but not 50% or more, the process starts over for that specific
        > type (ANO or FCT holder).

2.  Each member of the Website Committee shall continue to serve until
    > the occurrence of any of the following:

> \(i\) the member is removed by the Website Committee as set forth in
> Section 2.3.8;
>
> \(ii\) the member is removed by or leaves the entity/group appointing
> such member;
>
> \(iii\) the entity/group appointing such member is terminated or
> dissolved;
>
> \(iv\) the entity/group appointing such member ceases to qualify to
> appoint a member to the Website Committee; or
>
> \(v\) the member otherwise ceases to meet the requirements pertaining
> to the respective committee membership category.
>
> A member may resign at any time upon written notice to the Website
> Committee. A resignation is effective when the notice is delivered
> unless the notice specifies a later effective time.
>
> In the event that the member removed or resigned from the Website
> Committee was appointed by an entity/group listed in Section 2.2, a
> new appointment shall be made by the entity/group unless the
> entity/group ceases to qualify to appoint any member to the Website
> Committee.

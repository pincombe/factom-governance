1.  Working groups
    ==============

    1.  Definition and roles
        --------------------

        1.  In the Factom Protocol, a working group can be defined as a
            > group of individuals that research and discuss together
            > towards a common goal or to operationalize, refine, or
            > otherwise improve a specific need in the Factom ecosystem.

        2.  Working groups are typically comprised of volunteer-based
            > participants, and are completely self forming whenever a
            > need surfaces.

        3.  A working group is inclusive towards all people wanting to
            > participate with the understanding that participation
            > means active engagement in the working group.

        4.  In some circumstances, the need to form a formal committee
            > out of the working group emerges. The formation or
            > disbanding of a committee is a part of governance, and the
            > way in which a committee forms follows the process
            > specified later in this document. A committee can be
            > created without first being defined as a working group.

        5.  Working groups have no formal role in governance.

        6.  [[Doc 209 (Factom Working Groups]{.underline} [&
            > Committees)]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/114zsEo2JNyVaT2diW_DYHxSSVHIL6Ql3wkR4VfWeg7U/edit?usp=sharing)
            > shall be updated by the Factom Guides whenever new working
            > groups and committees are formed or disbanded or whenever
            > a chairman is elected or removed.

    2.  Working Group Formation
        -----------------------

        1.  When work within the Protocol is required towards a specific
            > end, the discussion around forming a working group can
            > ensue. Formal discussion surrounding working group
            > formation should occur on the [[Factom protocol
            > forum]{.underline}](https://factomize.com/forums/) under
            > the section [[Committees and Working
            > Groups]{.underline}](https://factomize.com/forums/factom/committees-and-working-groups.17/).
            > Community members interested in forming a working group
            > should post a new thread in this area to discuss the
            > possibility of forming the working group with the
            > community.

        2.  In principle, a working group can be created without
            > requiring a (formal) approval. If the community responds
            > positively on the Factom Protocol subforum during the
            > discussion period, and believes that the working group
            > would be meritable (such as by fulfilling a needed,
            > valuable, and specific goal), then the will of the
            > community, both via written support in the created thread
            > and/or by expressing interest in actively participating in
            > the working group, can lead to the working group\'s
            > formation.

        3.  Individuals interested in joining the working group should
            > vocalize this intent via the respective forum thread.

        4.  Working groups are formed informally via the
            > discussion-based process in the relevant forum thread, can
            > accept new members into the working group at any time, and
            > may specify a maximum amount of members permitted to
            > participate in the working group at any one time.

        5.  Since working groups itself are no legal or formal entity,
            > there exists no on-chain basis of payment for working
            > groups. However, individuals in working groups could seek
            > funding from private sources or via Grant funding for
            > specific tasks deemed appropriate by the working group.

        6.  Discussion surrounding working group formation, subsequent
            > updates, and/or disbandment of working groups are posted
            > in the aforementioned Factom Protocol subforum, thereby
            > "Factomizing" all public input and dialogue that occurs
            > surrounding working group matters.

    3.  Working Group Governance
        ------------------------

        1.  Once a working group has been formed with a set of
            > individuals, companies, or organizations identified as
            > members of the working group, the working group can decide
            > to appoint a chairman if they so desire.

        2.  The working group chairman can for instance be appointed via
            > a majority vote within the working group, however, each
            > working group may determine, for themselves, if and how
            > they appoint a chairman.

        3.  The working group itself decides how to remove a chairman,
            > such as by using a majority vote. If no consensus can be
            > reached, the disbandment of the working group is also an
            > option. Again, this is something the working group itself
            > decides, as a working group has no formal position within
            > governance or within the Factom Standing Party system.

2.  Committees
    ==========

    1.  Definition, role, and formality
        -------------------------------

        1.  Committees may exist or form to fulfill any purpose as
            > identified as needed in the Factom Protocol by the
            > Standing Parties. It is a body of persons delegated to
            > consider, investigate, take action on, or report on
            > matters. Current and previous committees are available in
            > [[Doc
            > 209]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/114zsEo2JNyVaT2diW_DYHxSSVHIL6Ql3wkR4VfWeg7U/edit?usp=sharing).

        2.  Because committees are comprised of multiple individuals
            > and/or members within multiple organizations/companies, it
            > is believed that to best simplify communication and
            > leadership, a committee chairman must be appointed to lead
            > the committee in matters of direction and communication.

        3.  Committees have a more formal role in Factom governance and
            > follow formal protocols set out in this document. They are
            > recognized by the Standing Parties and once formed are
            > specifically named in [[Doc
            > 209]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/114zsEo2JNyVaT2diW_DYHxSSVHIL6Ql3wkR4VfWeg7U/edit?usp=sharing).

        4.  Committees represent the will of the community as they must
            > be formed via the ANO and Guide vote procedures described
            > in Section 2.2, whereas working groups do not represent
            > the community as they do not have to be formed via any
            > sort of vote procedure.

        5.  A (former) working group could grow into a committee by
            > following the same procedure as forming a new committee.
            > That means that any appointed positions from the working
            > group, like a chairman, have to reapply and follow the
            > exact procedures as for any new committee formation.

        6.  Any committees that existed and operated prior to the
            > ratification of this document have to re-form themselves
            > via the formation process described in Section 2.2 to
            > continue to operate as a formally recognized committee by
            > the Factom standing parties.

    2.  Committee Formation
        -------------------

        1.  A committee can only be created with a (formal) approval of
            > the ANOs and Guides. If the community responds positively
            > on the Factom Protocol subforum during the discussion
            > period, and believes that the committee would be meritable
            > (such as by fulfilling a needed, valuable, and specific
            > goal), then the community, via verbal support in the
            > created thread and/or by expressing interest in actively
            > wanting to participate in the committee, can lead to the
            > committee's formation vote.

        2.  There shall be a minimum of eight (8) days of open
            > discussion regarding the committee formation to give
            > interested parties a reasonable opportunity to discuss.

        3.  Entities interested in creating and/or joining the committee
            > should vocalize this intent via the respective forum
            > thread.

        4.  Committees can accept new members into the committee at that
            > time, and may specify a maximum amount of members
            > permitted to participate in the committee at any one time.
            > After formation, it is up to committees, themselves, to
            > change any of these requirements.

        5.  Upon conclusion of the discussion, a vote shall be initiated
            > on a platform utilized by the Factom community. The voting
            > period shall be three (3) days, and ANOs and Guides are
            > eligible to vote. For the formation motion to pass, there
            > shall be an affirmative vote from four-fifths (⅘) of the
            > total number of Guides and three-fifths (⅗) of the total
            > number of ANOs.

        6.  If the formation motion does not obtain the required
            > affirmative vote, no further action shall be taken, and
            > the formation process shall be terminated.

        7.  If the motion is passed by the ANOs and Guides, the
            > formation of the committee becomes effective immediately.

        8.  A committee that has been formed can create their own
            > criteria and/or process for joining the committee, as long
            > as these are publicly documented in a thread on the Factom
            > Protocol subforum under [[Committees and Working
            > Groups.]{.underline}](https://factomize.com/forums/factom/committees-and-working-groups.17/)

        9.  The committee has to publicize at least the following
            > publicly available information in a Factomized document,
            > that can be referenced from [[Doc
            > 209]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/114zsEo2JNyVaT2diW_DYHxSSVHIL6Ql3wkR4VfWeg7U/edit?usp=sharing).

            1.  The name of the committee

            2.  The goal of the committee

            3.  The committee chairman, including the history of
                > chairmans (predecessors)

            4.  The maximum term of the chairman specified in months

            5.  The maximum amount of members (if any)

            6.  How to join the committee; how candidates can apply,
                > including any requirements.

            7.  Any mandates of the committee for which no consultancy
                > of the ANOs and Guides is required

            8.  The target audience of any reporting, including whether
                > the reporting takes place in a private/closed setting
                > or not

            9.  The maximum reporting interval to the target audience

        10. Discussion surrounding committee formation, subsequent
            > updates, and/or disbandment of committees are posted in
            > the aforementioned Factom protocol subforum, thereby
            > "Factomizing" all public input and dialogue that occurs
            > surrounding committee matters.

    3.  Appointing a Committee Chairman
        -------------------------------

        1.  Once a committee has been formed with a set of individuals,
            > companies, or organizations identified as members, the
            > committee has to appoint at least one chairman.

        2.  The committee chairman should possess strong leadership
            > skills, should push the committee forward, should motivate
            > the members, should identify and parse out sub-goals of
            > interest and work towards achieving these goals, and
            > should communicate with the community, ANOs, and Guides
            > openly and succinctly.

        3.  A chairman of a committee cannot have an indefinite term.
            > The committee has to publicize the maximum term for a
            > chairman.

        4.  The committee Chairman must be appointed via a majority vote
            > by the ANOs and Guides.

        5.  In the event of a committee chairman election tie, a vote
            > re-run will occur involving all members that tied for
            > first in running for the chairman position. If there is a
            > majority winner, that individual will become the chairman.
            > In the event a tie still occurs after the vote re-run, the
            > individual that first announced their interest in becoming
            > the chairman on the Factom Protocol subforum will become
            > the new chairman of the committee.

    4.  Removing a Committee Chairman
        -----------------------------

        1.  The chairman of a committee should be effective as described
            > in Section 2.3.2, but if a chairman is not effective or is
            > neglectful in their duties, the mechanism for removing a
            > chairman should occur as described below.

        2.  A member of the committee itself, or an ANO or Guide, must
            > formally begin a discussion as well as a vote on the
            > Factom Protocol subforum related to the possibility of
            > removing a chairman.

        3.  Because committees are considered to be more formalized
            > within our governance structure, a chairman can only be
            > removed via a majority vote of the ANOs and Guides; no
            > quorum is necessary here. Prior to any vote, the
            > discussion period must last eight (8) days, and after the
            > discussion period ends, the vote may begin. The voting
            > period must last five (5) days for the ANOs and Guides to
            > vote.

        4.  If it is decided that a chairman should be removed, via
            > majority vote as determined on the Factom Protocol
            > subforum, then the ANOs and Guides should start electing a
            > new chairman to the committee according to chapter 2.3.4.

    5.  Dissolving a Committee
        ----------------------

        1.  A member of the committee, or an ANO or Guide, must formally
            > begin a discussion as well as a vote on the Factom
            > protocol subforum related to the possibility of dissolving
            > the committee. The committee does not decide itself to
            > dissolve; it needs formal approval.

        2.  Because the formation of committees is considered to be a
            > formalized process within our governance structure, a
            > committee can only be dissolved via a majority vote of the
            > ANOs and Guides.

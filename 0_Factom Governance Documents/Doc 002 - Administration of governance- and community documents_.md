1.  Introduction
    ============

    1.  This document (this "Document") describes the process for
        > creating, ratifying, amending and retiring Factom governance
        > and community documents (hereinafter referred to individually
        > as "Factom document" or "document" and collectively as "Factom
        > documents" or "documents").

    2.  This Document is limited in duration and scope and is intended
        > to remain in force until a more comprehensive administration
        > system is developed and approved by the Standing Parties.

    3.  The ratified Factom documents are listed in [[Doc 000, Table
        > 1]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kr9IR4MhM-L9PCTY8YgEZRd5c-hyUp-SIs7mA2lDK9o/edit?usp=sharing).
        > This table shall be updated when there is any change to the
        > status of the Factom documents.

    4.  The word "ratify" in the context of this Document is used to
        > describe the approval process of a document by the Standing
        > Parties, currently the ANOs. After a document has undergone
        > the ratification process, it is referred to as "approved."

    5.  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings
        > ascribed to them in [[Doc 001 Factom
        > Governance]{.underline}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RVaVR7lvfGgOBMG-7oca9TtpnR7qaEfr6XJVaZJwd3M).

    6.  Parts of this document refers to specific functionality in the
        > "community forum". If these specific functions are not
        > available as described for any reasons, the standing parties
        > may facilitate the voting process on a suitable community
        > platform adhering to the process described in this document.

 

2.  Ratification of Documents
    =========================

    1.  A Standing Party may make a motion to ratify a document.

    2.  Ratification of a document shall undergo two distinct phases:

-   Ratification motion and review period

-   ANO-vote

    1.  The document creator or its representative with standing in the
        > Factom protocol shall make the document available to the
        > Standing Parties for review and thus officially makes the
        > motion to ratify the document.

        1.  The document shall be stored on the Factom governance Google
            > Drive, in the folder
            > [[/XX-Draft-Documents/]{.underline}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QTvHAWw92swZnqblzNrSMHvcGOPsesM-).

        2.  The document draft should be created in accordance with the
            > document templates available in the folder
            > [[/2\_Informational and
            > Records/]{.underline}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1owPqPrlv_KpQwSQr2J0ML0Uhdv4yqvvm)
            > in the Factom governance google drive.

        3.  The document shall be named in accordance with the following
            > format:

> "\[Document name (including doc nr if existing doc)\] - \[Version
> X.X.X\]"
>
> E.g: "Doc 001 Factom Governance - Version 1.0.4"

4.  A "Timed Discussion Thread" shall be created in the Document
    > Ratification subforum of the community forum with the tag "draft".
    > A short description of the document and why ratification is
    > requested shall be included.

    1.  When creating the Timed Discussion Thread, the "*This is a
        > Document Ratification / Amendment*" option shall be selected,
        > which will automatically invite all Standing Parties.

5.  The default discussion period shall be eight (8) days but can be
    > extended or shortened using the built-in features of the Timed
    > Discussion threads on the forum.

6.  The document creator shall have the right to edit the documents
    > during the discussion period and shall record the version history
    > in the document version log as described in Section 3.2. The first
    > draft shall be labeled as "0.1" and the final version subject to
    > voting shall be labeled as "1.0".

> Note: Upon successful ratification the draft version numbers shall be
> removed and only the version 1.0 (or for re-ratification of documents:
> x.0) shall be included.

2.  Upon conclusion of the discussion period, the Timed Discussion
    > software will invite ANOs to vote.

    1.  The poll shall include the options of "yes" and "no" and only
        > the ANOs will be able to vote. The poll shall be created
        > without the option for votes to be changed once submitted and
        > shall close after all ANOs have cast the votes or five (5)
        > days after the poll has become open, whichever is earlier.

    2.  The affirmative vote by three-fifths (3/5) of the ANOs shall be
        > required in order for the document ratification process to be
        > successful.

3.  The document shall become ratified and effective immediately after
    > it has received the necessary ANO votes and shall be incorporated
    > into the Factom document structure at the earliest convenience.

4.  Ratified documents shall be Factomized in accordance with the
    > procedures set forth in [*[Doc 211 Factomization
    > Instructions]{.underline}*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RSRXaNz0RSILgzDwsThEC3ttWFNjauTkMikU3xWFuBo/edit?usp=sharing)
    > and registered in [[Doc 201 Verification
    > hashes]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gFguzGSbQ1l3xmE_nx3hq_hqd49KEvsOpGdty98Pyqo/edit?usp=sharing)*.*

5.  If the document fails to be ratified, it can be revised and
    > resubmitted in the future.

3.  Control matrix & version history
    ================================

    1.  Each Factom document shall have an approval matrix on page 2, in
        > the format set forth below, which contains the information
        > stating which parties in the Factom ecosystem are allowed to
        > approve any changes to it.

![](.//media/image2.png){width="5.8125in" height="2.388888888888889in"}

2.  In addition to the control matrix, each document shall include a
    > version history log in the format set forth below:

![](.//media/image1.png){width="5.421875546806649in"
height="1.7004090113735784in"}

1.  The blue columns are used by the party who initially drafted the
    > document or suggested changes to it at a later stage, while the
    > pink ones are reserved for document approval by relevant parties.

2.  Version numbering

    1.  The first digit (**[1]{.underline}**.0) is increased if the
        > document is "re-ratified" by â…— ANO vote.

> *Example: **1**.0 -\> **2**.0*

2.  The second digit (1.**0**) is increased if the document is changed
    > by a single entity with approval authority.

> *Example: 2.**0** -\> 2.**1***

4.  Amendment of Documents
    ======================

    1.  A Factom document shall be amended in accordance with the rules
        > set forth in the document's control matrix described in
        > Section 3 of this Document.

        1.  The amendments that require a **single entity's** approval
            > can be made on an ad hoc basis and the community is not
            > required to be notified of such an amendment.

        2.  The amendments that require approval from the **Standing
            > Parties** shall be made in accordance with the procedures
            > set forth in Section 2 except that a Standing Party may
            > propose changes to a ratified document by adding the
            > changes directly to the document in the community
            > governance folder as Google Document "suggestions." The
            > process required for ratifying new documents shall then be
            > followed.

5.  Retirement of Documents
    =======================

    1.  In the normal course of events where a document ceases to serve
        > a substantive purpose in the community, it may be retired with
        > the same level of approval needed to modify the document as
        > set forth in its document control matrix. The retirement
        > procedure for ratified documents shall follow Section 2 where
        > a Standing Party shall propose the retirement of a specific
        > document by posting a thread in the Factomize "Document
        > Ratification" subforum with the tag "retirement."

> The same review period and voting process required by Section 2 shall
> be followed and upon a successful retirement vote the document shall
> be moved to the [[/5\_Retired
> Documents/]{.underline}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bsUb9l8xOE65gE6opoXFcJhIUj7faeFj)
> folder in the community governance Google Drive structure.

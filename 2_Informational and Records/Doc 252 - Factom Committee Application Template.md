1.  Introduction
    ============

    1.  According to [<span class="underline">Doc 006 - Working Group &
        > Committee
        > Framework</span>](https://factomize.com/forums/documents/doc-006-working-group-committee-framework.117/)
        > (section 2.2) a Factom Committee can only be formed by an
        > affirmative vote by the Factom Standing parties. The process
        > is started by the would-be committee members creating a forum
        > post in the protocol forum expressing their wish to form a
        > committee, and where they present relevant information about
        > the proposed committee so the standing parties can make an
        > informed opinion when deciding to support the formation or
        > not.

    2.  There are no hard requirements about what information the
        > would-be committee should provide the Standing Parties.
        > However, after a successful formation the committee shall
        > publish the information referenced in Doc 006 section 2.2.9,
        > so it is suggested that this tentative information is also
        > made available during the committee formation. With this in
        > mind, the template in section 3 of this document is based on
        > the required information in Doc 006, section 2.2.9.

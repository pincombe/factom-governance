22:12:02	 From Jason Chen : @ DBGrow, Factoshi, Syncroblock
22:12:30	 From HashnStore - Elie : Paul, could you say whether a chunk of that FFWD SAFE investment will be funneled into the direct and sole development of the Protocol? In other terms, can we expect an acceleration of the protocol development?
22:14:05	 From HashnStore - Elie : I get the point. Financing is ensured, but no acceleration.
22:14:25	 From HashnStore - Elie : Ok, thanks Paul.
22:14:28	 From Bobby : Is it on track though?
22:16:16	 From Bobby : Thanks
22:20:21	 From Bobby : A cheeky question: Can some of the $6m be ‘loaned’ for the legal review grant needed to move other aspects forward?
22:20:36	 From HashnStore - Elie : Paul, can we expet the name of your first client to be announced soonish? It could easily trigger an impact big enough to bring some fresh air to the FCT price, in which case it would further ensure the financing of the protocol.
22:20:40	 From HashnStore - Elie : expect*
22:21:25	 From Factom, Inc : thank you everyone
22:21:28	 From Bobby : Thanks Xavier
22:21:32	 From HashnStore - Elie : Cheers all.
22:21:41	 From Dan G- MoF : Thanks!
22:21:41	 From Perly : thank you 
22:21:44	 From Normie : Thanks!
